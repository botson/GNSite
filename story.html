							<h2>Early Life</h2>
							<p>Born on the 15th day of March, 1966, in Jos Plateau State, Gyang Nyam Shom, Pwajok, popularly referred to as “G.N.S” based on his initials, has lived a greater part of his childhood in this growing cosmopolitan City. He attended the Jos Township Primary School, (1972 – 1977), Saint Murumba College, Jos (1977 – 1982), the School of Preliminary Studies, Keffi; (1982 – 1984), the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1984 – 1987) and the Post Graduate School of the University of Jos, where he earned a Master of Science Degree in Political Economy and Development Studies in 1991 at the age of 24.</p>

							<img src="assets/img/candidate-fancy.png" alt="" class="alignleft">
							<p>From his undergraduate days at the world renowned Faculty of Social Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, he gained the unexpected bonus of being taught by reputable scholars like the late Dr. Bala Usman, Dr. Mahmud Tukur, Dr. Patrick Wilmot amongst others.</p>

							<h2>Career Begining</h2>
							<p>His special interest in Research and Development enhanced his creative and active involvement in multi-ethnic Non-Governmental platforms with programmes and projects designed to facilitate peaceful coexistence in significant parts of Nigeria.</p>
							<p>From his National Youth Service (NYSC) in Imo State (1987 – 1988) he taught Government and History at Zang Secondary Commercial School, Bukuru (1989 - 1993). He was engaged as a Lecturer with the Department of General Studies, of the Plateau State Polytechnic, and became Head of Citizenship Education Unit, Secretary of the Departmental Research Committee as well as Editor of Plateau Poly Newsletter. The Department of Political Science, University of Jos found him worthy of appointment and engaged him in 2003 to serve as Lecturer thus providing him the opportunity to teach Public Enterprise Management, Political Economy, Public Administration, the Politics of the World Economy, Theories of Rural Development amongst others at both undergraduate and Post graduate levels, where he distinguished himself as a promising scholar.</p>

							<h2>People Oriented Programs</h2>
							<p>Conscious of the potentials of youth involvement in politics and the future of democracy in Nigeria, G.N.S. Pwajok has been actively engaged in the formation of virile youth groups and platforms with clear focus on the problems of poverty and development. He was elected as the National Social and Cultural Secretary of the Berom Youth Movement in 1994 and subsequently, Public Relations Officer of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Plateau State Chapter where he pioneered the publication of the ‘Youthscope’ Magazine as Editor-in-Chief from 1996 – 1998.</p>

									<h2>Government Appointments</h2>
									<p>As a young man, God has exalted him to an even greater honour. While serving as lecturer, Governor Jang, his political mentor appointed him to the office of Director General, Political, Research and Planning in 2007 and now Chief of Staff, Government House, testifying to the fact that he has established himself as one of the moving spirits in the struggle for the building of a just society and a leading figure in the struggle for social change especially amongst the youth in Plateau State.</p>
									<p>He actively participated in the Transition Committee and subsequently served as Secretary of the Committee that produced the Four Year Strategic Development Plan, soon after the Jonah Jang administration was inaugurated in 2007. The Orientation Retreat for political office holders in Plateau State which mid-wived the Ten-Point Agenda was anchored through his office as Director General, Political, Research and Planning charting a roadmap for policy options under the current dispensation. Under the tutelage of Governor Jonah David Jang, a man that is never daunted by the size of any challenge nor ready to compromise basic principles of good governance, GNS Pwajok has continued to gain public recognition as a loyal, humble supporter of this worthy course. He has tirelessly served as an advocate of the Jonah Jang vision which is anchored on bringing about a new Plateau State in the hands of God and a people working together patiently towards responding to the development challenge of building a new era of progress which requires turning away from old policies, values and practices that have failed us and confidently embracing the responsibility to try better ways of doing things thus laying a solid foundation for sustainable poverty reduction, wealth creation, value orientation and stable democratic governance.....</p>

									<h2>GNS Pwajok’s Contributions to State Government</h2>
									<p>As a result of this commitment, he has had even greater challenges and responsibilities during the first four years of the Jang Administration. He has served in various capacities:</p>

									<h2>A Man of Vision and Insight</h2>
									<p>G.N.S. Pwajok has equally written several articles in Newspapers, journals, magazines and books apart from attending to relevant media engagements to clarify contemporary controversial public issues and State matters. He presented the Plateau State Memo before the Abisoye Panel to the acclaim of many and has featured on several talk shows on Radio and Television. Thus his recent leadership concern cannot be divorced from his earlier theoretical constructs and thinking:</p>
									<p>
										<ol>
											<li><p> His MSc theses titled “Class, Leadership and Political Development in Nigeria: The Paradox of a transiting Neo-colonial State” – laid bare his thoughts about the challenging reality of leadership in Nigeria.</p></li>
											<li><p> His presentation “Youth, Politics and the Future of Democracy in Nigeria” which took place during the Save Democracy Conference with the theme “Sustaining Democracy in Nigeria: The Role of Youth” June 12, 2010 at the Congress Hall, Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, reveals his thoughts on youth matters, while his views on character reform are captured in his Paper “Cultism, Character Clubs and Consciousness: Challenges on Campus”, presented at an orientation lecture, organized by the National Association of Political Science Student’s in 2004. In 2007, the Association gave him an Award of Merit in recognition of his contribution to knowledge and service to Plateau State. He has been a recipient of several other awards.</p></li>
											<li><p>His thoughts about Education are conveyed in his assessment of “UBE Implementation: Focus on Political Hurdles” a paper he presented at a workshop on “Improving job performance of primary school Head Teachers: current challenges and strategies” – while his Alma-matta St. Murumba College, Jos gave him the opportunity to deliver the 50th Anniversary Lecture which he titled “The Future of education in Nigeria: challenges and opportunities” – 2009. Nursing Departments and Tutors of the Ministry of Health, Plateau State also organized a series of workshops where Pwajok presented papers. Notable amongst which was a paper which he titled “Continue Thinking – Continue Education: Reflections on the future of life-long learning in Nursing” in June 2006.</P></li>
											<li><p>As a grassroots mobilizer, G.N.S. Pwajok has been variously concerned as is evident at different times in other papers such as – “Party Politics and Local Government Administration”, - presented on occasion of the sensitization workshop on roles, structures and functions of Local Government functionaries (1998) and “Grassroots Development through effective public Relations” presented at a Workshop on Communications for Development, organized for Senior officers of LGC’s. “Towards winnable Elections: Key Achievements and issues in the Plateau Project” is another interesting paper presented at a Training programme for youth volunteers of the Directorate of Youth Mobilization, Jang Campaign Organization on 14th of February, 2011. This set the stage for issues-based campaign for the 2011 elections vigorously undertaken by the Redemption Youth group which he chairs as Patron.</p></li>
											<li><p>As recent as three days ago, G.N.S. Pwajok was invited by the Plateau State House of Assembly for a pre-inauguration induction training held at the Leadership Institute, Jos on 2nd June, 2010 where he Presented a paper titled “Balancing power with Responsibility: Reflections on Executive/Legislative Relations”. Thus his understanding of politics as something to do with State power, its seizure, its consolidation and its use, has been further reinforced by his earlier concern for leadership at all levels as exemplified in a soon-to-be-publicly-presented autobiography of a prominent Legislator in the Northern Regional House of Assembly, Hon. Moses Nyam Rwang Kanang, which he titled: Moses of the Middle Belt. This autobiography sets out the life and times of his grandfather who has been a role model in the pre-independence struggles of the Middle Belt. Inspired by this 94 year old, who died just before his grandchild was appointed Director-General and now Chief of Staff – Government House, G.N.S. Pwajok has never hesitated to be a spokesman of the under privileged and takes special interest in locating personal and societal problems. Those who know him attest to the fact that he is a workaholic, focused and profoundly imbued with the guest for knowledge. He is a member of a social network; The Middle Belt Dialogue.</p></li>
											<li><p>As one of the beneficiaries of Governor Jang’s appointments to the youth of this State, it will appear that the older generation, are happiest at old age when they can take youth to the threshold of the good and new, like the mythical father of the West, point out the promised land to the younger generation; saying: you and only in a hard fight will have to make this your own, because what is handed over to you, what you have not won for yourselves, is never truly your own.</p></li>
