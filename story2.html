							<h2>Early Life</h2>
							<p>Born on the 15th day of March, 1966, in Jos Plateau State, Gyang Nyam Shom, Pwajok, popularly referred to as “G.N.S” based on his initials, has lived a greater part of his childhood in this growing cosmopolitan City. He attended the Jos Township Primary School, (1972 – 1977), Saint Murumba College, Jos (1977 – 1982), the School of Preliminary Studies, Keffi; (1982 – 1984), the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1984 – 1987) and the Post Graduate School of the University of Jos, where he earned a Master of Science Degree in Political Economy and Development Studies in 1991 at the age of 24.</p>

							<img src="assets/img/candidate-fancy.png" alt="" class="alignleft">
							<p>From his undergraduate days at the world renowned Faculty of Social Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, he gained the unexpected bonus of being taught by reputable scholars like the late Dr. Bala Usman, Dr. Mahmud Tukur, Dr. Patrick Wilmot amongst others.</p>

							<h2>Career Begining</h2>
							<p>His special interest in Research and Development enhanced his creative and active involvement in multi-ethnic Non-Governmental platforms with programmes and projects designed to facilitate peaceful coexistence in significant parts of Nigeria.</p>
							<p>From his National Youth Service (NYSC) in Imo State (1987 – 1988) he taught Government and History at Zang Secondary Commercial School, Bukuru (1989 - 1993). He was engaged as a Lecturer with the Department of General Studies, of the Plateau State Polytechnic, and became Head of Citizenship Education Unit, Secretary of the Departmental Research Committee as well as Editor of Plateau Poly Newsletter. The Department of Political Science, University of Jos found him worthy of appointment and engaged him in 2003 to serve as Lecturer thus providing him the opportunity to teach Public Enterprise Management, Political Economy, Public Administration, the Politics of the World Economy, Theories of Rural Development amongst others at both undergraduate and Post graduate levels, where he distinguished himself as a promising scholar.</p>

							<h2>People Oriented Programs</h2>
							<p>Conscious of the potentials of youth involvement in politics and the future of democracy in Nigeria, G.N.S. Pwajok has been actively engaged in the formation of virile youth groups and platforms with clear focus on the problems of poverty and development. He was elected as the National Social and Cultural Secretary of the Berom Youth Movement in 1994 and subsequently, Public Relations Officer of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Plateau State Chapter where he pioneered the publication of the ‘Youthscope’ Magazine as Editor-in-Chief from 1996 – 1998.</p>

									<h2>Government Appointments</h2>
									<p>As a young man, God has exalted him to an even greater honour. While serving as lecturer, Governor Jang, his political mentor appointed him to the office of Director General, Political, Research and Planning in 2007 and now Chief of Staff, Government House, testifying to the fact that he has established himself as one of the moving spirits in the struggle for the building of a just society and a leading figure in the struggle for social change especially amongst the youth in Plateau State.</p>
									<p>He actively participated in the Transition Committee and subsequently served as Secretary of the Committee that produced the Four Year Strategic Development Plan, soon after the Jonah Jang administration was inaugurated in 2007. The Orientation Retreat for political office holders in Plateau State which mid-wived the Ten-Point Agenda was anchored through his office as Director General, Political, Research and Planning charting a roadmap for policy options under the current dispensation. Under the tutelage of Governor Jonah David Jang, a man that is never daunted by the size of any challenge nor ready to compromise basic principles of good governance, GNS Pwajok has continued to gain public recognition as a loyal, humble supporter of this worthy course. He has tirelessly served as an advocate of the Jonah Jang vision which is anchored on bringing about a new Plateau State in the hands of God and a people working together patiently towards responding to the development challenge of building a new era of progress which requires turning away from old policies, values and practices that have failed us and confidently embracing the responsibility to try better ways of doing things thus laying a solid foundation for sustainable poverty reduction, wealth creation, value orientation and stable democratic governance.....</p>
